In python.org I looked through the FAQ since I am new to python.
In terms of learning python, I found the genral section to be guide for a beginner like me, it was very helpful.
So pyhton is a free programming language that is supposed to be easy to learn and has a clear syntax.
Looking at its successes I saw that python is used by many big companies like Google, Facebook, Instagram, and many more.
It was also used in a drug discovery project which is very interesting.
Overall python seems to be an extensively known and used programming language,that is new to me.
