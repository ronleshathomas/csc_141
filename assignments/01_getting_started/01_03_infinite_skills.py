"""
For my programs I want to make something fun, something colorful, and something different.
So my something fun would be a game, similar to crossy road.
My something colorful would be a drawing program, where you can draw and colorin different pictures.
My something different would be a music program, where you can make your own music, by using the keyboard.
These are ambitious but I hope to understand python by the end of this.
